 Notes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This driver is intended for STM32\+F4xx families devices only.
\item The I2C EEPROM memory (M24\+LR64) is available on separate daughter board ANT7-\/\+M24\+LR-\/A, which is not provided with the STM32\+F429I DISCOVERY board. To use this driver you have to connect the ANT7-\/\+M24\+LR-\/A to CN3 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{stm32f429i__discovery__eeprom_8c_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{connector of STM32\+F429\+I DISCOVERY board.}\label{stm32f429i__discovery__eeprom_8c_autotoc_md1}
It implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to this memory. The needed STM32\+F4xx hardware resources (I2C and GPIO) are defined in \mbox{\hyperlink{stm32f429i__discovery_8h}{stm32f429i\+\_\+discovery.\+h}} file, and the initialization is performed in EEPROM\+\_\+\+IO\+\_\+\+Init() function declared in \mbox{\hyperlink{stm32f429i__discovery_8c}{stm32f429i\+\_\+discovery.\+c}} file. You can easily tailor this driver to any other development board, by just adapting the defines for hardware resources and EEPROM\+\_\+\+IO\+\_\+\+Init() function.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In this driver, basic read and write functions (BSP\+\_\+\+EEPROM\+\_\+\+Read\+Buffer() and BSP\+\_\+\+EEPROM\+\_\+\+Write\+Page()) use DMA mode to perform the data transfer to/from EEPROM memory.

Regarding BSP\+\_\+\+EEPROM\+\_\+\+Write\+Page(), it is a optimized function to perform small write (less than 1 page) BUT The number of bytes (combined to write start address) must not cross the EEPROM page boundary. This function can only write into the boundaries of an EEPROM page. This function doesn\textquotesingle{}t check on boundaries condition (in this driver the function BSP\+\_\+\+EEPROM\+\_\+\+Write\+Buffer() which calls BSP\+\_\+\+EEPROM\+\_\+\+Write\+Page() is responsible of checking on Page boundaries).
