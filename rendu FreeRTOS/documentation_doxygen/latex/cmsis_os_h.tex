The file {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{cmsis__os_8h_source}{cmsis\+\_\+os.\+h}}}} is a template header file for a CMSIS-\/\+RTOS compliant Real-\/\+Time Operating System (RTOS). Each RTOS that is compliant with CMSIS-\/\+RTOS shall provide a specific {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{cmsis__os_8h_source}{cmsis\+\_\+os.\+h}}}} header file that represents its implementation.

The file \mbox{\hyperlink{cmsis__os_8h_source}{cmsis\+\_\+os.\+h}} contains\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item CMSIS-\/\+RTOS API function definitions
\item struct definitions for parameters and return types
\item status and priority values used by CMSIS-\/\+RTOS API functions
\item macros for defining threads and other kernel objects
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Name conventions and header file modifications}}

All definitions are prefixed with {\bfseries{os}} to give an unique name space for CMSIS-\/\+RTOS functions. Definitions that are prefixed {\bfseries{os\+\_\+}} are not used in the application code but local to this header file. All definitions and functions that belong to a module are grouped and have a common prefix, i.\+e. {\bfseries{os\+Thread}}.

Definitions that are marked with {\bfseries{CAN BE CHANGED}} can be adapted towards the needs of the actual CMSIS-\/\+RTOS implementation. These definitions can be specific to the underlying RTOS kernel.

Definitions that are marked with {\bfseries{MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED}} cannot be altered. Otherwise the CMSIS-\/\+RTOS implementation is no longer compliant to the standard. Note that some functions are optional and need not to be provided by every CMSIS-\/\+RTOS implementation.

{\bfseries{Function calls from interrupt service routines}}

The following CMSIS-\/\+RTOS functions can be called from threads and interrupt service routines (ISR)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item os\+Signal\+Set
\item os\+Semaphore\+Release
\item os\+Pool\+Alloc, os\+Pool\+CAlloc, os\+Pool\+Free
\item os\+Message\+Put, os\+Message\+Get
\item os\+Mail\+Alloc, os\+Mail\+CAlloc, os\+Mail\+Get, os\+Mail\+Put, os\+Mail\+Free
\end{DoxyItemize}

Functions that cannot be called from an ISR are verifying the interrupt status and return in case that they are called from an ISR context the status code {\bfseries{os\+Error\+ISR}}. In some implementations this condition might be caught using the HARD FAULT vector.

Some CMSIS-\/\+RTOS implementations support CMSIS-\/\+RTOS function calls from multiple ISR at the same time. If this is impossible, the CMSIS-\/\+RTOS rejects calls by nested ISR functions with the status code {\bfseries{os\+Error\+ISRRecursive}}.

{\bfseries{Define and reference object definitions}}

With {\bfseries{\#define os\+Objects\+External}} objects are defined as external symbols. This allows to create a consistent header file that is used throughout a project as shown below\+:

{\itshape Header File} 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <cmsis\_os.h>}                                         \textcolor{comment}{// CMSIS RTOS header file}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Thread definition}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{extern} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} thread\_sample (\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} \textcolor{keyword}{const} *argument);             \textcolor{comment}{// function prototype}}
\DoxyCodeLine{osThreadDef (thread\_sample, osPriorityBelowNormal, 1, 100);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Pool definition}}
\DoxyCodeLine{osPoolDef(MyPool, 10, \textcolor{keywordtype}{long});}

\end{DoxyCode}


This header file defines all objects when included in a C/\+C++ source file. When {\bfseries{\#define os\+Objects\+External}} is present before the header file, the objects are defined as external symbols. A single consistent header file can therefore be used throughout the whole project.

{\itshape Example} 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include "{}osObjects.h"{}}     \textcolor{comment}{// Definition of the CMSIS-\/RTOS objects}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define osObjectExternal   }\textcolor{comment}{// Objects will be defined as external symbols}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include "{}osObjects.h"{}}     \textcolor{comment}{// Reference to the CMSIS-\/RTOS objects}}

\end{DoxyCode}
